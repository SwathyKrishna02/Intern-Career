# Intern-Career

During this internship, I was tasked with completing two projects: "Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster" and "Breast Cancer Wisconsin." Below are concise summaries of each project along with their respective goals and outcomes:

## 1. Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster

#### Objective:
To develop a survival prediction model for Titanic passengers based on key features such as age, sex, passenger class, and embarkation point.

#### Approach:
I conducted thorough data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. Next, I explored various classification algorithms and techniques, including cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, to select the best-performing model.

#### Outcome:
After rigorous evaluation, the Random Forest classifier emerged as the top-performing model. This model demonstrates promising accuracy in predicting survival outcomes, offering valuable insights into the factors influencing passenger survival aboard the Titanic.


## 2. Breast Cancer Wisconsin

#### Objective:
To develop a predictive model for classifying breast tumors as either malignant or benign based on features extracted from digitized images of breast mass.

#### Approach:
I utilized the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, a widely used benchmark in machine learning and medical research. After thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, I explored various machine learning algorithms to develop an accurate predictive model.

#### Outcome:
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset provided a comprehensive feature set and clear target variable, making it suitable for developing predictive models for medical diagnosis and research. By leveraging techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, I developed a robust model capable of accurately classifying breast tumors, aiding in early detection and diagnosis.

These projects provided valuable hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, contributing to my understanding of machine learning techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios.
